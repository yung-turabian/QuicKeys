* Examples
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: gpgme-python3-examples
  :END:

  The contents of this directory are the examples included in the /GNU
  Privacy Guard (GnuPG) Made Easy Python Bindings HOWTO/ file.  Each
  script is explicitly for Python 3 and specifically for Python 3.4 or
  later.

  Some of these scripts may work with Python 2.7, but there are no
  guarantees.  They will include the relevant imports from the
  =__future__= module to facilitate that if possible.

  Unless otherwise stated, all the examples in this directory are
  released under the same terms as GPGME itself; that is they are dual
  licensed under the terms of both the GNU General Public License
  version 2.0 (or any later version) *and* the GNU Lesser General
  Public License version 2.1 (or any later version).
