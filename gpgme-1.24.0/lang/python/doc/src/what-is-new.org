Last time the most obviously new thing was adding the /What's New/
section to the HOWTO.  Now it's moving it out of the HOWTO.


** New in GPGME 1·13·0
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: new-stuff-1-13-0
   :END:

Additions since GPGME 1.12.0 include:

- Moving the /What's New/ section out of the basic [[file:gpgme-python-howto.org][HOWTO]] document and
  into its own file so as to more readily include other documents
  beyond that HOWTO.
- Moving the preceding, archival, segments into [[file:what-was-new.org][another file]].
- Added =gpg.version.versionintlist= to make it easier for Python
  developers to check for a specific version number, even with beta
  versions (it will drop the "-betaN" part).
- Added expanded detail on issues pertaining to installing for Windows
  users.
- Bindings enter [[file:maintenance-mode][maintenance mode]] from January, 2019.
- Added documentation on maintenance mode and what changes can be made
  to the code when in that status.  Essentially that boils down to bug
  fixes only and no feature requests.
- The import-keys-hkp.py example script, which uses the =hkp4py=
  module to search the SKS servers for a key, has been tightened up to
  search for both hexadecimal key IDs and user ID strings with reduced
  chance of unnecessary repitition.  There may still be some
  repetition if a key includes a user ID matching the hexadecimal
  value of a key ID.
