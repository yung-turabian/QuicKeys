The "gpg" module is a python interface to the GPGME library:
<https://www.gnupg.org/software/gpgme/>

"gpg" offers two interfaces, one is a high-level, curated, and idiomatic
interface that is implemented as a shim on top of the low-level
interface automatically created using SWIG.

This way we make simple things easy, while still providing the entire
functionality of the underlying library.
